            <div class="life">
                What is life? how can someone put the existance of a species into words.
            </div>
            <div id="manmade">
                <p>The world we live in right now is manmade. According to science the only law of the world is Hunt or be hunted.
                <br>
                <p>DIviding ourselves geographically,economically, socially, racially, genderwise, and all together species wises humans have broken the law of the nature and created<br>
                a community of humans with power, money that defines us. Now the law is please your boss or be pleased by your subordinates. In all the aspects not just organization.<br>
                </p>
            </p>
            </div>
            <div class="life">
               But are  we suppose to live this manmade world or follow the law of nature. Or can we meet in the middle.
                <div id="explained">
                <p> It is no doubt that by creating communities humans have expanded their understanding of life but also now have restrained their life around these communities. We have come far from time where a single person determined the life of community.
                Bravery measured in killing of other communities for geographical aspects i.e to attain more power. Humans have come a far way but still not reached to actual understanding that we belong to the same community. One Community - HUMANS. 
                In todays world, due to globalisation, internet, a voice has been made available for every one. your opinions matter. also your opinions affect other peoples opinion. So now people have raised voices when they have seen something bad, inhumane, happy, sad, scary and other moments
                in the whole world. People have expanded their knowledge of humans by medical research and also now importance to mental health. </p>
